<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You must get the letter and quickly deliver it to the boss to give him some good news!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience wanting to get the maximum reward from finally delivering the letter to the boss.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The idea for this game is to grab the letter, and get it to the boss as quickly as possible.  I couldn't really get the boss to chase the player so that's going to be a goal and I would also like to incorporate some kind of multiplayer if possible.  I also had trouble with the tiling for some reason I still havent been able to resolve and the art is a little lacking, I'm not a very good artist and I was having trouble finding assets so that's something that will definately need polish.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I really want to get the basic platforming for this game down.  I feel that my other prototypes were lacking the that sense.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I'd like to implement some kind of timer and also have the boss potentially get upset with the letter and come chasing after you and then the player must make it back to their office before the boss catches them.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player works at a newspaper publishing company.  There have been hard times in the office lately so the Boss is in a terrible mood.  One day, a letter from a major distributor comes in the mail.  This could be your big chance to get the Boss some good news and get onto his good side!  You must get the letter, avoid any obstacles, and get the letter to the Boss.  The only catch is... The letter might have bad news!  If this happens you must rush back to your office before the Boss catches you!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game kind of has a story, most of which I mentioned in the setting/premise section.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual Gamer.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Only a few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There aren't really a variety of strategies to take on in this game, the premise is very simple but there is that chance that the letter will have bad news.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
