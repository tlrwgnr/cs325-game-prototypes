<h2>Starships</h2>
<ul>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You command a starship and must defeat your opponent.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Some strategic choices and some of the anxiety inducing decisions that come with managing these types of situations when trying to defeat your oppenent.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The main aspects of gameplay will consist of choosing a ship and then proceeding to enter into an almost battleship like exchange, except you attack your oppenent using your resources as well as upgrade your ship and such.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I want to explore creating a turn based game in phaser.  Phaser has been great for platformers but I am curious to see how it handles turn based games.
I'd also love to eventually get the game to have a kind of Startrek vibe where you're the ship commander, but I guess this would be way more combat focused that Startrek.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Some features include being able to pick a ship from a few choices and to upgrade and manage your ship while battling your opponent.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a newly christened captain in the Imperial Republic, you must battle against the opposing forces to prove your worth.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game kind of has a story, most of which I mentioned in the setting/premise section.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual Gamer.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Probably 5 - 15 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There aren't really a variety of strategies to take on in this game, the premise is very simple but how you build up and choose your ship can differ case to case.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
